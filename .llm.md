# Notes for LLM prompts (multiviewer)

**ProjectDescription**

We have a large number of RTP feeds on our network we would like to compose together as a 'multiviewer' instance.

**Architecture Plan**
1. Using a csv file as a data registry, we create a polars dataframe of these values
2. Fill out X,Y,H,W values for each dataframe cell to model a grid per the dimensions of the Screen
2. Render a Backdrop Mosaic using Checkered Grey/DarkGrey Squares with Channel Names in Cells
3. Asynchronous Processes:
    1. Render placeholder text (yellow) '...' in the corresponding cell
    2. Establish Connection to RTP Feed
        - Success: Render Video Over the Corresponding Cell of the Grid
        - Failed: FailedAttempts++; Try Again
    3. After 3 Failed Attempts, Exit and convert placeholder text as (red) '{ipAddress} failed'
